# QuidditchVR

Snitch it if you can!

## Introduction

This project was created for the TML 2018 College Festival.
TML (Tatva Moksh Laksh) is a Cultural festival in SIES Graduate School of Technology.

This was designed as a VR game designed to run on android phones.
That would allow players to enjoy the experience of flying on a broom in VR.

The Core mechanics of the game were pretty simple. The player has to pass through hoops in an overworld and catch the golden snitch at the end.
