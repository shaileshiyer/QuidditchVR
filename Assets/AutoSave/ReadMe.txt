Version 1.0



Instructions
------------
Once you import the AutoSave package into your project... 
You're done! Wow that was easy.

Now whenever you run your scene to test it out, it should automatically save your work.



Disclaimer
----------
I've been using this for a while and so far I haven't lost any work. Hopefully you won't either.
However, there are still cases where Unity can crash before (or while) my Auto Save logic is running
resulting in you losing work. Sad day... :( But I'm not responsible. This asset is free so don't 
be a jerk and tell me I owe you money. I don't. :) Instead, I recommend you take a look at the
recovery links below. You still might be able to get your lost work back!
